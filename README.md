# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
We used the voting data across Colorado counties to determine the winner of the election. We calculated the total number of votes cast, the number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes each candidate won and the overall winner.

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.8.5, Visual Studio Code 1.49.2

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
A total 369,711 votes were cast in the election.

The candidates were:
* Charles Casper Stockham
* Diana DeGette
* Raymon Anthony Doane.

* Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
* Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,829 number of votes.
* Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.

The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote and a total of 272,829 votes.

## Challenge Overview and Results

In the Challenge, we built on the code we previously wrote to show the winner of the election. We calculated the total votes cast in each county to determine which county has the largest voter turnout.

The counties were:
* Jefferson County
* Denver County 
* Arapahoe County

* A total of 38,855 votes were cast in Jefferson county, which was 10.5% of the total votes cast.
* A total of 306,055 votes were cast in Denver county, which was 82.8% of the total votes cast.
* A total of 24,801 votes were cast in Arapahoe county, which was 6.7% of the total votes cast.

Denver county had the largest voter turnout, with 82.8% of all votes cast in the county and a total of 306,055 votes.

## Election-Audit Summary

This script can be used for any future elections to determine the winning candidate and counties with the largest voter turnout. The code provides generic candidate and county variables to be used in various functions. If the commissioner would like to use this code in another election, they can update the lines where the county and candidate names are extracted from the data source (depending on number of columns). They may also update the output and the writing to the text file to show the results differently.
